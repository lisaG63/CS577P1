Project Specification: Problem:You’ve been invited to a game show called “The Money Room”!  You will be allowed to enter the money roomand stay for as long as you want, but once you leave the room you can never go back in.  Each minute you spend inthe money room, some amount of money will either be given to you or taken away. You need to decide when to enterthe room and when to leave.  Being a poor college student, you don’t care how long you spend in the room, you justwant to maximize the amount of money you walk away with at the end of the show.  Luckily, one of your friends isan intern for the show and knows the show’s plans.  They give you a list of the money that would be given to you (ortaken away) at every minute. What’s the maximum profit you can make?Formally, you are given an integer arrayAof lengthncorresponding to the amounts given to you or taken away.You must return 0 if it is not possible to make any profit or the maximum value ofvwherev(a, b) =∑b−1i=aA[i]fora, b∈Nand0≤a≤b≤n.Input should be read in from stdin.  The first line will contain the number of elements in the array (n) and allsubsequent lines will contain values ofA. For example, input array[0,1]will be represented as “2\n0\n1” (spacesadded here for reading clarity).
